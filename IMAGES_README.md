# Images and Assets

## Do You Need Images?

**Short answer: No, you don't need to upload images for the basic portfolio structure.**

The reference website (sanjeevsriram.com) uses a **minimal, text-focused design** that doesn't require many images. The design relies on:

- Clean typography
- Text-based content
- Minimal visual elements
- Simple, elegant layout

## Optional Images You Can Add Later:

If you want to enhance your portfolio, you can optionally add:

1. **Project Screenshots/Thumbnails** - For your project case studies
2. **Profile Photo** - Optional hero section image
3. **Project Images** - Screenshots of your UI/UX work
4. **Motion Design Samples** - GIFs or videos for the Motion Design section

## How to Add Images (When Ready):

1. Create a `public` folder in your project root
2. Place images in `public/images/` folder
3. Reference them in your components like: `/images/your-image.jpg`

## Current Design:

The current design works perfectly without any images - it's a clean, professional text-based portfolio that matches the reference site's aesthetic.
